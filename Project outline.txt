### **Step-by-Step Guide for Project 1: Secure Corporate Network Design**

---

### **Phase 1: Planning and Initial Setup**

#### **Step 1: Define Project Scope**
- **Objective:** Design a secure corporate network using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on VLANs, ACLs, port security, and VPNs.
- **Network Requirements:**
  - Departments: HR, IT, Sales.
  - Devices: PCs, switches, routers, and servers.
  - Security Measures: VLAN segmentation, ACLs, port security, and VPN for remote access.

#### **Step 2: Setup Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Download & Install:** Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system.
- **Create a New Project:** Open Cisco Packet Tracer and create a new project file.

### **Phase 2: Network Design and Implementation**

#### **Step 3: Design the Network Topology**
- **Add Devices:**
  - Drag and drop switches, routers, PCs, and servers into the workspace.
  - Connect the devices using appropriate cables (copper straight-through for different devices, copper crossover for similar devices).
- **Label Devices:**
  - Name the devices according to their role, e.g., HR-PC1, IT-Switch, Sales-Router.

#### **Step 4: Configure VLANs**
- **Create VLANs:**
  - Access each switch's CLI and create VLANs for HR, IT, and Sales.
  - Example Command: `Switch(config)# vlan 10` (For HR).
- **Assign Ports to VLANs:**
  - Assign switch ports to the corresponding VLANs.
  - Example Command: `Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10`.
- **Verify VLAN Configuration:**
  - Use `show vlan brief` to verify VLANs are correctly configured.

#### **Step 5: Configure Inter-VLAN Routing**
- **Router-on-a-Stick Setup:**
  - Configure a router to allow communication between VLANs.
  - Example Commands:
    - `Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10`
    - `Router(config-subif)# encapsulation dot1Q 10`
    - `Router(config-subif)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0`
- **Test Connectivity:**
  - Use ping tests between devices in different VLANs to ensure inter-VLAN communication is functioning.

#### **Step 6: Implement ACLs**
- **Define ACLs:**
  - Create ACLs to control traffic between VLANs.
  - Example Command: `Router(config)# access-list 101 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any`
- **Apply ACLs:**
  - Apply the ACLs to the appropriate router interfaces.
  - Example Command: `Router(config-if)# ip access-group 101 in`.
- **Test ACLs:**
  - Attempt to ping or access resources to ensure ACLs are enforcing the desired security policies.

#### **Step 7: Configure Port Security**
- **Enable Port Security:**
  - On each switch port, configure port security to restrict unauthorized devices.
  - Example Command: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security`.
- **Set Maximum Devices:**
  - Limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
  - Example Command: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 2`.
- **Define Action on Violation:**
  - Set the action (e.g., shutdown) if a violation occurs.
  - Example Command: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation shutdown`.
- **Test Port Security:**
  - Connect unauthorized devices to test if port security is functioning correctly.

#### **Step 8: Setup VPN**
- **Configure Site-to-Site VPN:**
  - On the router, configure a VPN to securely connect a remote branch to the main network.
  - Example Commands:
    - `Router(config)# crypto isakmp policy 10`
    - `Router(config)# crypto ipsec transform-set MYSET esp-aes esp-sha-hmac`
    - `Router(config)# crypto map MYMAP 10 ipsec-isakmp`
- **Test VPN:**
  - Simulate a remote connection and verify secure communication through the VPN.

### **Phase 3: Testing and Documentation**

#### **Step 9: Testing the Network**
- **Simulate Attacks:**
  - Attempt unauthorized access or device connections to test network defenses.
- **Monitor Network Traffic:**
  - Use Packet Tracer's simulation mode to observe traffic flow and ensure security measures are effective.

#### **Step 10: Document the Project**
- **Network Diagram:**
  - Create a detailed network diagram using Cisco Packet Tracer or a diagramming tool like Lucidchart.
- **Configuration Files:**
  - Save and export all device configurations from Packet Tracer.
- **Project Report:**
  - Include the following sections in your documentation:
    1. **Project Overview:** Brief description of the project, objectives, and scope.
    2. **Network Topology:** Include a screenshot or diagram of the network topology.
    3. **VLAN Configuration:** List VLANs, associated devices, and configurations.
    4. **ACLs:** Document the ACLs implemented, their purpose, and where they are applied.
    5. **Port Security:** Explain the port security setup and how it was tested.
    6. **VPN Configuration:** Describe the VPN setup and how it secures remote access.
    7. **Testing Results:** Summarize the testing phase, including any simulated attacks and their outcomes.
    8. **Conclusion:** Reflect on the projectâ€™s success, challenges faced, and potential improvements.

### **Phase 4: Finalizing and Sharing**

#### **Step 11: Export and Share**
- **Save Project:**
  - Save the Cisco Packet Tracer project file.
- **Upload to GitHub:**
  - Create a new repository on GitHub.
  - Upload the Packet Tracer file, configuration files, network diagram, and project report.
  - Include a `README.md` with a brief overview, instructions on how to open the project, and key features.
  
#### **Step 12: Update Your CV**
- **Add the Project to Your CV:**
  - Update your CV with the project details, including a link to the GitHub repository.
  
Example:

**Project Title:** Secure Corporate Network Design
