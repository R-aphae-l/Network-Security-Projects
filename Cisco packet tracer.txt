Project 1: Network Security with Cisco Packet Tracer
Project Title: Secure Corporate Network Design
Objective:
Design a secure corporate network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Implement security measures such as VLANs, ACLs (Access Control Lists), port security, and VPNs to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.

Steps:
Network Topology: Design a network topology with multiple departments (e.g., HR, IT, Sales) using switches and routers.
VLAN Configuration: Segment the network into different VLANs for each department.
Inter-VLAN Routing: Configure inter-VLAN routing to allow communication between VLANs while applying security controls.
ACL Implementation: Apply ACLs on routers to control traffic flow between VLANs, allowing only authorized traffic.
Port Security: Implement port security on switches to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
VPN Setup: Configure a site-to-site VPN to securely connect a remote branch office to the corporate network.
Testing: Simulate attacks like unauthorized access attempts and test the network's response to these threats.
